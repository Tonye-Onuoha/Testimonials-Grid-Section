## My process

The process was very straightforward. I started by writing out the stucture of my HTML. I then created a CSS stylesheet
and broke down the styling of elements one piece at a time using the CSS grid and flexbox layout model. Finally, I
proceeded to write the media queries for both the mobile and desktop design.

### Built with
